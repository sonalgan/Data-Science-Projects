# Human Activity Recognition using SmartPhones
## Description

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Human Activity Recognition with SmartPhones project, part of the Data Science Projects repository. The project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies human activities based on data collected from smartphone sensors.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Various conventional machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest are explored, optimized, and compared. Additionally, AutoML techniques are utilized to automate the model selection process.
